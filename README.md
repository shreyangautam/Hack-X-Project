✨**About the Project**

Talking to your kids about money at an early age can help them understand the value of the Rupee, how to save for long-term goals and how to spend responsibly. Teaching children about finances can build financial literacy and give them a stronger ability to manage their finances later in life.

Our website helps Kids to learn about finance through various interactive videos and stories. Our aim is teach kids about smart financing So that differentiating between things they need and things they want.

✨**Inspiration**
Values cannot be taught to anyone overnight.Children demand things as is their right and in their naivety. They don’t know the value of money and hence demand things.If we don’t teach them the value of money from a young age, then they’ll keep spending money without giving it a second thought.
