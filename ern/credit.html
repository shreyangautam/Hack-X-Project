        <section>Sam: Rams, guess what happened!<br>
            Varsha borrowed Utkarsh's shin guards for soccer practice because she couldn't find hers. Then she wore them home.
            </section>
        <section>Ram: Well, that's ok. Maybe she planned to wash them before she returned them to Utkarsh.<br>
            Sam: But she didn't. Now, she can't find them!
            </section>
        <section>Ram: OH, NO, Sam! That's awful. What is she going to do?<br>
            Sam: I don't know. I told her that you could help her decide what to do.
            </section>
        <section>Ram: Of course!<br>
            Sam:THAT'S GREAT! You're really smart, Rams. You can help her. She's at the soccer field. Okay, Sam, let's go!<br>
            Ram:  Varsha, Sam says that you have a problem. Maybe I can help you.
            </section>
        <section>Varsha: Oh, Rams, I lost Utkarsh's shin quards.<br>
            He has a game in two days.He can't play without shin guards.<br>
            
            Ram: Varsha, have you looked everywhere for them?<br>
            
            Varsha: Yes, I have. This happens to me a lot. I am always losing things.<br>
            </section>
        <section>Varsha : It's not so bad when I lose my stuff but sometimes I lose other people's stuff.<br> Utkarsh says he'll never lend me anything again, not even a piece of paper. I think he's being mean!<br>

            Ram: Varsha, when you lend something to a friend, don't you expect to get it back?<br>
            
            Varsha: Well, yes. But, I didn't lose Utkarsh's shin guards on purpose.
            </section>
        <section>Ram: Did you give it back to him?<br>
            Varsha: Uh, yes. But I had left it out in the rain. It wasn't in very good shape.<br>
            
            Ram: Well, I'm surprised that Utkarsh lent you his shin guards. Usually,<br> we only lend things to someone when we're certain that the person will take good care of them.<br>
            Sam: YEAH, VARSHA, I borrowed Heather's cheese maker. I broke it. Rams told me I wasn't a responsible borrower.<br> I didn't know what responsible meant. Do you know what it means, Varsha?
            </section>
        <section>Ram: No, Sam, I don't know what it means.<br>
            WELL, VARSHA...<br>
            Rams, let me tell her. I remember what you told me. I can tell her. PLEASE!
           <br> Okay, Sam, you may tell her.
            </section>
        <section>Sam: A responsible borrower is someone who can be trusted to return things borrowed or repay borrowed money.<br>

            That's right, Sam! Do you understand, Varsha?
            </section>
        <section>varsha: I think so. I didn't return Utkarsh's baseball glove in good condition. <br>Now, I've lost his shin guards so I can't return them. I haven't been responsible. What should I do?<br>
        Ram:Sam, tell Varsha what you did when you broke Heather's cheese maken Varsha, I took it to a repair shop and had it fixed.<br> I had it cleaned, too. Then I gave it back to Heather, <br>and I gave her a big piece of cheddar cheese, too.</section>
        <section>Why? Well, I kept the cheese maker a lot longer than I said I would because I had to have it fixed.<br>
            she had to buy all her cheese at the store while I had the cheese maker. <br>The piece of cheddar was to repay her for all the cheese <br>she had to buy!
             </section>
        <section> Rams said that I did just the right thing. Didn't you, Rams? Heather was happy to have the cheese maker back,<br> and she said she would let me borrow it again.<br>
            Ram:I'm glad because I like making my own cheese. I make cheddar, Swiss, cheddar, mozzarella, cheddar.<br> I love cheese, don't you? Why don't we have some right now?
