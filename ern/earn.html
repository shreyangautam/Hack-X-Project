        <section>Sam: No, wait Ram I want to tell this story<br>
          Ram: Sam it isnâ€™t nice to interrupt when someone is talking.<br>
          sam:I know Ram, but please let me tell the story.
        </section>
        <section>Ram: oh,all right <br>
          Sam:  Well boys and girls, do you remember when Sakshi said that she wanted to have a party?<br> Last week she decided to start planning her party, but she had a little problem. She had some money that<br> she received for her birthday from her grandmother. It wasn't enough to buy the ingredients she needed to make cookies and still have fun things to do at the party.<br> Sakshi just didn't know what to do.
          </section>
        <section>Sam: She thought and thought all day long. Still she didn't know what to do. That night she had a dream about planning the party. <br>Rams and I were in her dream. Here is what happened.<br>
        Rams told Sakshi that people earn money for work that they do. The money people earn is called income. <br>Sakshi's mom earns income because she is a doctor. Mr. Fuentes earns income from his bicycle shop. Will earns income when he walks dogs.<br>
        In her dream, Sakshi asked Rams and me what to do. Rams told Sakshi that the money she received from her grandmother was gift money.
        </section>
        <section>Did you ever receive gift money? Click on the types of gift money you have received.<br>
          Sam: Ram is really smart! He knows all about income. Don't you think he is smart?<br> I think he is smart. I bet you are smart, tool You know people who earn income.<br> Click on the people you know who earn income.

          *Sam, finish the story!*<br>
          Okay, okay I will.
          </section>
        <section>Sam: Sakshi likes to bake. I told Sakshi that she could earn income baking. I said she should bake cheese and peanut butter cookies.<br>
          Cheese and peanut butter cookies are my favourite! I told Sakshi she could sell them for $10 each. Everybody loves cheese and peanut butter cookies!<br>
          Except Rams said he didn't like cheese and peanut butter cookies, and he didn't think people would pay $10 for a cookie.
        </section>
        <section>Sam: When Sakshi woke up, she knew what to do. She would ask Mr. <br>Fuentes if he would pay her to bake a birthday cake for Miss Ellie.<br> Sakshi knew she could use some of her gift money to buy the ingredients for the cake.<br>
        Then she would have the gift money plus the income she earned for baking the cake to buy the things she wanted for her party.
        </section>
        <section>Sam: Sakshi asked Mr. Fuentes about the cake, and he said yes. Sakshi was so excited.<br> She made a beautiful and yummy cake for Miss Ellie's birthday. I was sad because it wasn't a cheese cake.<br> I would have liked a cheese cake. Cheese cake is my favorite. Don't you love cheese cake?<br><br>

          Ram: Sam, finish the story.
          </section>
        <section>Sam: Oops, I let the thought of cheese distract mel Well, NOW Sakshi has the money for her party. <br>Now she has a lot of decisions to make. But that's another story.<br>
        Rams gave me a quiz to see if I learned anything about money. I didn't want to take the quiz. But, guess what?<br> There was a surprise waiting for me after I took the quiz. Tell them about the quiz and the surprise, Rams. Please!</section>
        <section>Ram: Okay, Sam, I'll tell them. Boys and girls, the quiz is only a few questions for you to answer.<br> You click on the button next to the answer for each question. You can always change your mind. When you are finished, click on the okay button.<br>
          Sam: Hurry, Rams! Tell them about the surprise!</section>
        <section>Ram: After you pass the quiz, you may print out a clubhouse activity. After each story you read,<br>there's a quiz and a different clubhouse activity.<br>
          Sam: Don't worry about the quiz. If you don't get all the answers right, we'll help you. Then you can try again.
